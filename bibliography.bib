  abstract="User Experience (UX) has been intensively investigated lately, resulting in the proposal of several evaluation instruments, methods, and techniques. However, the definition of UX and its constructs is still a work in progress, making User Experience a concept open to various interpretations. Consequently, the development of UX evaluation methods and instruments rely on very different assumptions, often making professionals and beginning researchers uncertain about choosing the right methods to evaluate user evaluation aspects. Aiming to help fill in this gap, in this work we present the results of a systematic snowballing procedure conducted to investigate the characteristics of the UX evaluation instruments that have been proposed and used by HCI community in the last years. We compiled information about 116 instruments aiming to assist researchers and practitioners in making informed choices about which instruments can support UX data collection, according to their research goals. In addition to that, the data analysis provided a glance on the directions the research on UX evaluation instruments is taking.",
