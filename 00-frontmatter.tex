Understanding low-level computing principles can be beneficial for a wide variety of people - from the general public interested in computers, through practising software engineers, to Computer Science students.
Rather popular material is the open-source licensed Nand2Tetris ``taught at 400+ universities, high schools, and bootcamps" that explains how to build a computer from individual logic gates to high-level programming language \parencite{nand2tetrisweb}.
The material is accompanied by a desktop software that is hard to access or completely inaccessible from a new class of devices unsuited for desktop Java applications: Chromebooks that are seeing massive growth and now account for the majority of the US K12 market \parencite{Boreham_2019} \parencite{IDC_2021}, or mobile devices that account for 56\% of web traffic, up from only 6\% in 2011 \parencite{StatCounter_2021}.
The recently created web-based alternative, WepSIM, is showing promising results but takes a more complex look focusing on the CPU and instruction processing \parencite{garcia2019wepsim}.
